# Steam Shortcut Manager

# Getting Started

Note: Users need to be familiar with their Steam install and how to navigate through filepaths to get to the non-Steam game executable files.

1. Make sure Steam is closed so that changes made in the non-Steam games list will work correctly.
2. Provide the filepath (including drive letter on Windows) to the shortcuts.vdf file location. Example: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\< user_id >\config\shortcuts.vdf"
3. Refer to the About menu and/or mouseover on entry fieldnames for more information and advice.
4. Log any issues to the issue tracker with as much info as possible, screenshots are ideal so I can see what you see.
5. Pull requests welcomed!
