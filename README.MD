# Steam Shortcut Manager GUI

This Steam Shortcut Manager GUI project is intended to help work with a Steam install's shortcuts.vdf file - the list of data about non-Steam games added to Steam.

# Getting Started

TBD - need to create easy installer for this.

1. Make sure Steam is closed so that changes made in the non-Steam games list will work correctly.
2. Provide the filepath (including drive letter on Windows) to the shortcuts.vdf file location. Example: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\< user_id >\config\shortcuts.vdf"
